This is a JavaScript coding practice to use eventlisteners and update the DOM.

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in any of the dices, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.

Additional info.

1. A player loses his ENTIRE Score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
2. You can set your own winning score from the predefined score of 100. (Note: The game will reset)
